#### Systems Supervisor
I did a plethora of things, but mainly some of the items below were part of my schedule:

- **Provide support** to end-users, on-site and off-site (remotely);
- **Security and business continuity* (applying patches and responsible for incremental and full backups for critical systems)
- **Security audits and monitoring** (antivirus signature updates and applying firewall policies);
- Providing and writing useful documentation for end users;
- Continuous **preventive maintenance**, such as redoing cat cables, check WAP and VoIP phones;
- **Hardware** and **Software support**, for example, keeping servers, printers, POS and other end devices in working order;
- Virtualization with **Hyper-V**, **VMWare**;
- Active Directory management (**GPOs**, **AD Users**);
- **Office 365** administration;
- Working with **Opera V5** and **Simphony** (from Oracle - POS System);

Aside from the above, I would also enjoy improving some work efficiency by writing my own **Powershell Scripts** or even create scripts for end users in order to automate some of the tasks (using **Powershell** and packaging to an executable or with **Excel VBA**).

Another important part of the work was to make sure all devices were compliant with latest AV signatures and users would comply to security standards by the company.
We would advise on how to proceed with certain issues and send from time to time, emails with some short and objective information.

The great project during this period was to migrate all the end devices from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and all our servers to Windows Server 2016 (and virtualize some), and even on a tight schedule, this was done very successfully.
In the end, we ended up migrating around 150 PCs and laptops in 2 months and around 6 to 8 servers in those 2 months as well. All in all, it was a great endevour, but it came out great in the end.
