#### Helpdesk Support
This was my first role within IT, and some task I was responsible for:

- **Provide support** to end-users, on-site
- Helping the IT Supervisor with **Business continuity and security**, which consisted of installing patches, backups
and security audits / monitoring (antivirus and firewall);
- Continuous **preventive maintenance**, such as redoing cat cables and check WAP (rooms and conference rooms);
- **Hardware** and **Software support**, for example, keeping servers, printers, POS and other end devices in working order;
- Active Directory management (**GPOs**, **AD Users**);
- Working with **Opera V5** and **Simphony** (from Oracle - POS System);

Aside from the above, we create some **Excel VBA** scripts for end users in order to automate some tasks, mostly for the **Finance** and **Back Office** departments.

Another important part of the work was to make sure all devices were compliant with the latest AV signatures and users would comply to security standards of the company.
We would advise on how to proceed with certain issues and send from time to time, emails with some short and objective information.

As great deal of business was with conferencing, we had to make sure the **WAP** and **Guest Internet** was always working, or at least 99% of the time.
