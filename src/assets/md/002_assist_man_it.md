#### Assistant Manager of IT
During the time I was in London, I was responsible to do the following:

- **IT Support** for 6 different locations/hotels, as we were part of a Complex of hotels;
- **Rollouts** of new software/services in conjunction with our Director of IT;
- **Security and business continuity* (applying patches and responsible for incremental and full backups for critical systems)
- **Security audits and monitoring** (antivirus signature updates and applying firewall policies);
- Continuous **preventive maintenance**, such as redoing cat cables, check WAP and VoIP phones;
- **Hardware** and **Software support**, for example, keeping servers, printers, POS and other end devices in working order;
- Virtualization with **Hyper-V**, **VMWare**;
- Active Directory management (**GPOs**, **AD Users**);
- **Office 365** administration;
- Working with **Opera V5** and **Simphony** (from Oracle - POS System);

As we oversaw 6 different locations/hotels, we had to automate most of the processes.
So, we had to create several Powershell scripts that would handle critical system notifications as well as reboots and overall cleanup processes.
As we had most of our interfaces virtualized, we had to make sure those VMs were performing, so creating Powershell scripts for cleanup processes, were essential.

Another important part of the work was to make sure all devices were compliant with the latest AV signatures and users would comply to security standards by the company.
We would advise on how to proceed with certain issues and send from time to time, emails with some short and objective information.

The team was really great, and we had great synergy with each other.

We had a rotation for out of office hour support, and if anyone would need a week off that, we would work that out.

It was an awesome experience!
