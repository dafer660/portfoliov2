                good <strong>"bica"</strong>! (expresso).</>,

            content: <>I really like to keep fit and go to the <strong>gym</strong>, whether simply <strong>weight
                lifting</strong>, do some <strong>cardio</strong> or practice some <strong>kickboxing</strong>.</>,

                A little a bit about my personality, I consider myself
                a <strong>faithful</strong> and <strong>hardworking</strong> individual.
                Usually, I tend to be a <strong>quiet</strong> person and talk usually when required, unless we are in a
                more
                informal environment.
                I like to keep things in a <strong>positive</strong> way and spread that whenever possible (i.e. when
                it's
                opportune to do so).
                Another of my traits, is that I think about several outcomes, which, in a way, can be applied to every
                aspect of life, whether in the workplace or on our daily lives.</>,

            content: <>
                One of my hobbies is simply playing around with my <strong>Proxmox VE</strong> server,
                creating virtual machines, <strong>LXC</strong> or <strong>Docker</strong> containers. I am also
                very interested developing web applications
                with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Rest
                APIs</strong> and/or <strong>React JS</strong>. Even though I am at an early stage when it comes
                to React JS, I feel very comfortable
                with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> (and <strong>Jinja2</strong> templating).</>,

            title: 'Thoughts & Future',
            content: <>
                The combination of <strong>Systems Administration</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong> are
                two of my passions, as I enjoy creating new things. As a Sys Admin, I
                consider <strong>security</strong> essential, as my past roles consisted mostly on security audits.
                When it comes to the next couple of years, I see automation all over the place, as well as, remote
                work, which can be a good thing.
                In that sense, I am willing to learn new technologies and improve on them in order to catch up to
                future trends.
